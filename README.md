# multirotor-rate-converter

## description
a simple website to visualize the difference and compare rates of flight controller software

## purpose
provide a place where multirotor users can convert any flight controller rates from one type to another

## how it works
visualize rates types from most of the popular flight controller software on the same chart so you can convert, compare or see the difference between different rate settings

## faq
How do you know the rates are accurate? I don’t! I’ve entrusted our fate into the hands of the betaflight configurator devs. I borrowed their rate calculation file and gave them in a new place to show off their curves. 

### feature ideas
themes
incorporate the throttle slider
a way to convert the rates types from one another automatically finding the best line

### todo
- [ ] fit the chart better on mobile without distortion
- [ ] review betaflight configurator changes to see if we can merge them
